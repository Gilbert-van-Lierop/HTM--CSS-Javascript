    The name Suriname may derive from an indigenous people called Surinen, who inhabited the area at the time of European contact.[15]
    The suffix -ame, common in Surinamese river and place names (see also the Coppename River), may come from aima or eima, meaning river or
    creek mouth, in Lokono, an Arawak language spoken in the country.[16]
    The earliest European sources give variants of "Suriname" as the name of the river on which colonies
    were eventually founded. Lawrence Kemys wrote in his Relation of the Second Voyage to Guiana of passing a river called
    "Shurinama" as he travelled along the coast. In 1598, a fleet of three Dutch ships visiting the Wild Coast mention passing the river
    "Surinamo". In 1617, a Dutch notary spelled the name of the river on which a Dutch trading post had existed three years earlier as "Surrenant".

British settlers, who in 1630 founded the first European colony at Marshall's Creek along the Suriname River, spelled the name as "Surinam";
 this would long remain the standard spelling in English.[18] The Dutch navigator David Pietersz. de Vries wrote of traveling up the "Sername"
river in 1634 until he encountered the English colony there; the terminal vowel remained in future Dutch spellings and pronunciations. In 1640, a
 Spanish manuscript entitled "General Description of All His Majesty's Dominions in America" called the river "Soronama". In 1653, instructions given to
a British fleet sailing to meet Lord Willoughby in Barbados, which at the time was the seat of English colonial government in the region, again spelled
 the name of the colony "Surinam". A 1663 royal charter said the region around the river was "called Serrinam also Surrinam".
