<h1> Suriname </h1>
  <p>
    The name Suriname may derive from an indigenous people called Surinen, who inhabited the area at the time of European contact.[15]
    The suffix -ame, common in Surinamese river and place names (see also the Coppename River), may come from aima or eima, meaning river or
    creek mouth, in Lokono, an Arawak language spoken in the country.[16]
    The earliest European sources give variants of "Suriname" as the name of the river on which colonies
    were eventually founded. Lawrence Kemys wrote in his Relation of the Second Voyage to Guiana of passing a river called
    "Shurinama" as he travelled along the coast. In 1598, a fleet of three Dutch ships visiting the Wild Coast mention passing the river
    "Surinamo". In 1617, a Dutch notary spelled the name of the river on which a Dutch trading post had existed three years earlier as "Surrenant".
